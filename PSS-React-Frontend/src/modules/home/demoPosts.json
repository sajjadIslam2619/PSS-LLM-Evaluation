It feels more like a combination of responsibilities, expectations, and nonstop small tasks that keep piling up. Even when I finish something, I barely feel relief before the next thing pops into my mind. I am always trying to catch up, and the constant mental load is exhausting. What worries me is that I am starting to feel worn out in ways I did not notice before. I forget simple things, I lose focus easily, and even things I used to enjoy feel like obligations now. My brain never seems to get a break. At night I lie down hoping to rest, but instead I start replaying the day or planning tomorrow. It is like I am always on alert. I have been trying to take small breaks, step away from screens, and set boundaries, but I feel guilty when I do. The stress builds up faster than I can manage it. I know I need to slow down and reset, but I am not sure how to start.",

		"content": "Hey everyone. I am not really sure what I am hoping to get out of writing this, but I guess I just need to put these thoughts somewhere. I have been dealing with depression for a long time, but lately it feels different. Heavier in a way that is hard to describe. Not dramatic, not a sudden crash, just this constant dull weight that makes everything feel like I am walking through fog. The strange thing is that nothing “big” is wrong in my life. I have a decent routine, responsibilities, deadlines, the usual stuff. People around me think I am doing fine because I keep showing up. I go to work, respond to emails, laugh at the right moments. But inside, everything feels muted. Like I am watching my own life from a distance and struggling to feel anything about it. Even things I normally care about feel flat. What makes it harder is the guilt. I keep telling myself I should not feel this way because others have it worse, or because I “should” be grateful, or because being tired is normal and I am just overthinking. But that voice only makes me feel more stuck. I know guilt is part of the cycle, but knowing it and breaking it are two completely different things. Lately I have been withdrawing more than usual. I avoid messages because I do not want to pretend to be “okay.” I turn down plans because I cannot imagine getting through small talk without feeling exhausted. Even simple tasks like cleaning my room or making a proper meal feel overwhelming. I do them eventually, but they take so much more energy than they should. I have been trying to take small steps. Going for a walk at least once a day. Journaling even if it is just a few lines. Listening to music that feels grounding. Some days these things help a little. Other days they do not help at all and I feel ridiculous for trying. But I keep reminding myself that small things count, even when the progress is not obvious. I think the hardest part is feeling like I cannot explain this to people in my real life. I do not want to worry anyone, and I do not want to hear the usual “just stay positive” suggestions that make me feel misunderstood. Depression is not about being negative. It is about being overwhelmed by a tiredness that does not go away, a kind of emotional static that makes it hard to connect with the world. Anyway, if you read this far, thank you. I know everyone here is dealing with their own struggles and I appreciate this community for being a place where people can talk honestly without judgment. I guess I just needed to say out loud that I am trying. Even if progress is slow. Even if some days I do not feel it. I am still here and still trying to find my way forward.",

I am working on grounding techniques, but it is exhausting. Just needed to share somewhere people understand.",

		"content": "Lately my anxiety has been showing up even on days when nothing particularly stressful is happening. I wake up with this tightness in my chest and it follows me around all day, like my mind is waiting for something to go wrong even when nothing is happening. I keep trying to reason with myself, telling my brain that there is no real threat, but the worry keeps looping in the background. What makes it harder is that the symptoms feel physical as much as mental. My heart speeds up over the smallest things, and then I get frustrated because I know it is irrational. The more I try to control it, the worse it feels. It is like my thoughts are racing ahead of me, predicting disasters that will probably never happen, but still feel real in the moment. I have been trying grounding exercises and breathing techniques, and sometimes they help a little, but it feels like a constant effort. I just wish I could turn my mind off for a while and feel genuinely calm instead of “managing” anxiety all the time. If anyone has been through something similar, I would appreciate hearing what helped you.",
